            nurtured by his parents, with his father being an electrical
            engineer and his mother, a stenographer.His journey with Google
            began in 2004 when he interviewed at the Googleplex on April Fools'
            Day, coinciding with the debut of Gmail, which he initially thought
            was a joke. Key contributions to Google's growth Pichai's career at
            Google was marked by significant contributions, including his work
            on the Google Toolbar and the development of Google Chrome. He
            played a pivotal role in convincing Google executives to create
            their own web browser, Chrome, to counter Microsoft's move of
            setting Bing as the default search engine in Internet Explorer.
            Leadership and achievements His leadership extended to the Android
            division, where he oversaw the development of Chrome OS, the
            operating system for Chromebooks. Pichai's strategic vision and
            leadership qualities led to his appointment as Google's CEO in 2015.
